     division. The Shadow CEO shall be chosen by the current CEO and be certified by a vote of
     all active Epoch student members. A Shadow must be a Sophomore or Junior when they are
     instated.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4024x9">If a officer of the Board leaves Epoch (or graduates from IMSA), that officer&#8217;s Shadow shall take over his/her
     role if the officer&#8217;s Division provides a successful vote of confidence in the Shadow, or in the case of the
     CEO, a successful vote from all active Epoch Board and Shadow Board members. In the case
     that the vote fails, a new member shall be chosen by the Board and the voting process shall
     repeat.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4026x10">In Epoch Board meetings, each division shall have an assigned number of votes. The Technical division shall

     have one (1) vote, with the CFO allocated one (1) vote. The relations team shall have two (2) votes, with each
     of the CEO and CCO assigned one (1) vote. The CEO shall have one (1) vote. In the event that a Board

     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-4030x11">The Board must have the funding, resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, and

     the year. Meetings shall take place on the IMSA campus or via a digital platform, in areas accessible
     to all students.
     </li>
     <li

     Division.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-5008x4">Epoch Board or the leadership of a Division may choose to hold a closed meeting to discuss on sensitive
     topics. It is expected that if a meeting is closed to an officer or shadow officer, that officer should not
     directly join the meeting. However, this does not bar them from asking questions.</li></ol>

     unless the Epoch staff advisor provides written approval for the expense.
     </li>
     <li

     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7004x2">The supermajority of the Board members shall constitute a quorum for transacting official Board business.
     When members are unable to be physically present, they may fully participate by teleconference. The
     technology must enable Board members to hear the other member(s) not physically present and enable the
     member(s) not physically present to hear the Board discussion.
         <ul class="itemize1">
         <li class="itemize">Rulings passed without quorum are null and void.</li></ul>
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7006x3">Board meetings shall follow a predetermined agenda, if one exists, with the Board having the ability to add
     and remove items if needed.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7008x4">The Board shall not pass any ex post facto rulings.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7010x5">Due process shall be followed in all proceedings.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7012x6">Disputes within a Division shall be handled within that Division based on the Division&#8217;s policies. If the dispute
     is between two members of different Division, a Board or Shadow Board officer from the unaffected Division or
     an unaffiliated Board or Shadow Board officer shall mediate. The CEO should often take this position as an
     impartial party.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7014x7">Board officers may take a sabbatical (where their Shadow or another designated Epoch member temporarily
     assumes their position) or resign their positions by writing a letter to the CEO. If an officer resigns, they may
     not apply to be reinstated until four weeks after the date which their resignation letter takes
     effect.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7016x8">If the Board loses trust in an officer, they can pass a motion of no confidence (the text of the motion including
     &#8220;this body has no confidence in [name] fulfilling [his/her/their] duties as [position]&#8221;) with a formal Board vote
     to remove the officer from their position.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7018x9">All Epoch members shall follow all Epoch, IMSA, state, and federal rules, regulations, and laws when
     representing Epoch and shall hold themselves to a high moral standard. The Epoch Board may open
     investigations into any events involving Epoch that do not follow these standards.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7020x10">Any formal Board vote must pass with a supermajority among the Board.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7022x11">To open an investigation, Board shall pass a resolution outlining the scope of the investigation and appointing
     someone to build the case against those investigated.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7024x12">Those investigated shall have the right to be informed of nature of the investigation, to review all evidence and
     confront all witnesses against him/her and to introduce his/her own evidence and witnesses, to obtain counsel
     within Epoch, to not bear witness against himself/herself, and not to be investigated twice for the same
     charges.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7026x13">For each investigation, a panel of two Board or Shadow Board members and one non-Board individual
     (potential panel members may recuse themselves) shall decide on the guilt and punishment of
     those accused. Punishments may range from a formal censure to a removal and ban from Epoch.

     In extreme cases, the results of an investigation and any evidence used may be forwarded to
     IMSA formal disciplinary officers. The outcomes of each case shall serve as precedence for future
     cases.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7028x14">If the panel decides on a guilty ruling against a Board member, it may also recommend his/her removal on
     ethics. If such a recommendation is made, the Board shall vote on it at its next meeting and a majority vote
     shall result on the member&#8217;s removal.
     </li>
     <li 
  class="enumerate" id="x1-7030x15">All non-confidential materials of an investigation shall be made available to Epoch members upon

     Technical Division and Board have the power to recall a system administrator&#8217;s access privileges (including a

     <li
